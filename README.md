# Java Stock API
This is Nigel and Nick's Stock API that we made for our APCS Final Project!

## About
There is both a Terminal Version and a GUI Version. We reccomend the GUI Version :-)
- Terminal Version: Able to choose which stock to look at and look at each value separately (i.e. Price, Market Cap, Range, etc.)
- GUI Version: Able to choose stock and look at all different kinds of info at once (same values as above), Able to create account and loggin, Able to add to Watchlist.

You'll need VSCode in order to run and enjoy this program.

We plan to work on this even after the due date to make this even better than it is now.
We also plan to make this Open Source, that way if there are people interested in this project, they will be able to freely suggest things!

Enjoy!
